# Github Pages Set Up with Vite

This actually caused me a slight headache so I"m documenting this here in case I ever do this again. This is a link to the [Vite GH Pages Doc](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy#github-pages)  

## Troubleshooting

### Add `Base=REPO` to Vite Config
It says this in the docs but just do this

### Add Base Repo to Main
I added the gh repo as the base endpoint for my app in the main.tsx file

### Github Actions
verify `.github` folder is in root directory and the yml file is configured correctly
